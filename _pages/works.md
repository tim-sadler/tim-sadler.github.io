Take a look at a selection of projects I worked on either in academia, business or teaching. Most of these projects were conducted in teams. More information about the context and co-authors upon request.

## Business

| Project Description | Research Focus | Data type | Methods used | Status |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Retention Modeling | Conceptualizing and developing a retention model and ETL pipeline for a non-contractual mobility setting. | Transactional | Simple heuristics, linear models, CDK, AWS Batch, GitHub Actions, Docker | on-going |
| Dynamic Pricing | Maintaining and enhancing a dynamic pricing microservice for a mobility provider. | Transactional | Test-based Data Science, Non-linear models, AWS Batch, Docker, MLFLow | on-going |
| Brand perception of energie provider | Survey-based research on a multitude of brand-related mesaures and customer satisfaction. | Survey | Linear models, Principal Component Analysis, Cluster Analysis | final |
| Success drivers of <em>brand space</em> event | Survey-based research on the perception of a temporary live marketing campaign and its effects on the brand perception for an insurance company | Survey | Linear models, Principal Component Analysis, Cluster Analysis | final |
| Predict cart abandonment | Based on sales data, we predict the probability for a customer to abandon their shopping cart via an artificial neural network. | Sales data | ANN, Keras & Tensorflow | final |

## Scientific

| Project Description | Research Focus | Data type | Methods used | Status |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Impact of 9 € Ticket on private mobility provider | Estimating the effect of the government subsidized 9 € Ticket on the customer base of a private mobility provider. | Survey + Transactional | Propensity Score Matching | final |
| Short and long-term effect of bundle promotions | Based on actual sales data, we investigate whether customers react towards bundle promotions with higher number of store visits, higher quantity purchased and higher spending. | Sales data | Linear & logit models, Maximum Simulated Likelihood | on-going |
| Value of customer relationship depending on acquisition type | Based on actual sales data, we look at the value of a customer relationship on multiple levels. We specifically investigate differences in key customer behavior (e. g. repeat purchase,  disount-proneness, probability to return an order) depending on wether they were acquired by a discount, or not. | Sales data | Network analysis, linear & logit models, simulation | on-going |
| Experiment: Response to product bundles | We systematically varied different types of product bundle framings and measured customers' response for our focus brand against a competing brand.  | Survey, eperimental | logit & count model, Maximum Simulated Likelihood | on-going |

## Teaching

These projects were either conducted under my supervision or created by me to teach and illustrate methods in class.

| Project Description | Research Focus | Data type | Methods used | Status |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Experiment: Effect of premium promotions | Measure the response (brand choice probability & attractiveness) of subjects towards different premium promotions. | Survey | Linear & logit models, Structural Equation Modeling | final |
| Media consumption behavior | Survey-based research on the media consumption behavior, media spending and technology usage. | Survey | Linear & logit models, Principal Component Analysis | final |
| Qualitative: Money-back-guarantees | Explore what might impact customer behavior in light of fast-moving consumer good's money back guarantees. | Qualitative | Focus group analysis | final |

## Fun

I sometimes do silly stuff to increase my skill set or learn new tools.

| Project Description | Research Focus | Data type | Methods used | Status |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Radio playlist | Web scraping and analysing my favorite radio stations playlist over one year. | Scraping | Web scraping, exploratory analysis | fun |
| Urban gardening | Monitor and analyze my balcony plants' hydration level via sensors and RaspberryPi. | Sensor data | RaspberryPi & Python | fun |
| Getting rich | Create a Python trading robot that utilizes Poloniex API to automate micro crypto transactions. | API data | Polonies API & Python | still not rich |
